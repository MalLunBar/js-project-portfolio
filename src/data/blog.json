      "description": "It Takes Two is one of the most fun and imaginative games I've ever played. It's built around two players truly depending on each other, like a chaotic dance you figure out together. Cody and May were planning for a divorse but get's stuck inside doll-bodys that belongs to their daughter. They need to start fixing their relationship by collaborating and communicating in order to get back into their real bodys. The world is quirky and beautiful, like stepping into a Pixar movie. I also have to mention Dr. Hakim, the Book of Love! He's so much fun and brings amazing energy to the adventure. I loved how the game kept surprising me with new ideas and made teamwork feel so rewarding.",

      "description": "TowerFall is basically the ultimate couch multiplayer game. It's a super fast-paced archery battle where you and your friends (or enemies) shoot, dodge, and even catch arrows mid-air across a bunch of chaotic little arenas. The matches are short but intense, and it somehow stays fun (and ridiculous) no matter how many times you play. It's one of those games where you're yelling at each other one second and laughing like crazy the next. Definitely one of the best party games out there if you like a bit of friendly chaos.",
